Client Side Search & Indexing Setup
================================================================================

Prereqs:
You'll need sun's latest java sdk and the ant build tool installed.
It might work with the open sdk but it's untested.

To Build:
Just type make. If everything works you'll have the applet jar in ./build,
if not, you'll have cryptic error messages from ant.

There is a pre-built binary in ./demo

Code of interest is in src/org/ubc/nss
