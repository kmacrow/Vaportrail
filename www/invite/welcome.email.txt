Thank you for your interest in Vaportrail!

The application is currently in a pre-release phase so we're monitoring account
creation to ensure the system is running smoothly. 

Please allow a few hours to recieve your invitation to create a new account. Once
you do receive an invite, we would really appreciate any feedback on your
experience with Vaportrail (which you can provide through the application.)

In the meantime, you might want to create a personal storage account with one
of the following services:

Vaporcaps: http://vaportrail.nss.cs.ubc.ca:8080/

- or -

NSS Caps: http://caps.nss.cs.ubc.ca/

You'll need a storage account to start playing with Vaportrail.

You might also want to check out http://vaportrail.nss.cs.ubc.ca/about to
learn a little more about Vaportrail and the philosophy behind it.

If you have questions or concerns, please contact 
Kalan MacRow <kalanwm@cs.ubc.ca>. 

Sincerely,

The Vaportrail Team
