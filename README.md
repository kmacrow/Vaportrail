# Vaportrail

Vaportrail began as a senior research project during my undergrad at UBC. We had a research group that was very interested in solving problems around privacy and data lock-in in online social networks and services. The group had built a decentralized storage system with a simple REST API and Vaportrail was intended to demonstrate a new, decentralized application model. It grew into a project in its own right, only to be abandoned when I started grad school. 

# Status

The project is a research prototype and hasn't been touched since May 2012. I intend to revive and polish it over the course of 2013. More news will be forthcoming.
